# React Tooltip Component

An experiment to try to figure out how best to display tooltips with React.

## Status

Don't use this, it's not complete yet and it doesn't work. Heck, you would have to jump trough a lot of hoops to get 
 this into your project anyway :)

## Run the examples

There are currently two examples. If you want to play around do this:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:janhancic/react-tooltip.git
cd react-tooltip
npm install
webpack --watch example/app[1|2].js example/bundle.js
```

Then just open `example/index.html` in your browser.
